view_rsent2.py - when performing rsentropy2 with printlevel = 4,
    a file called rsent2_data.m will be created, which shows,
    for each input pair, the H(Y|X)'s (i.e. entropy for the input
    pair given at each possible sample points for all other 
    inputs) that are used to compute E[H(Y|X)].
    This is useful to see the possible entropy reduction by 
    varying all other inputs (there is possibility that at
    certain settings of other inputs, the entropy reduction
    is actually negative or higher than total entropy).
