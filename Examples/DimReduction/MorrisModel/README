Morris problem 1: a complex function with 20 inputs
                  (The first 10 are important)

To run:

make to create psuade executable
cc -o morris_simulator morris_simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade_morris.in

To cross-check, use delta method
psuade psuade_delta.in

========================================================
Morris problem 2: the Morris problem with 100 parameters
                  in his original paper
                  (The first 30 are important)

cc -o morris_simulator2 morris_simulator2.c -lm
psuade psuade_morris2.in

========================================================
Morris problem 3: fail_simulator problem has sensitivities 
    that cannot be detected by the Morris method using
    4 levels.

cc -o fail_simulator fail_simulator.c -lm
psuade psuade_fail.in
