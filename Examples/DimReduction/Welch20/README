For input variable screening purposes, it can be found 
that some input variables of this function have a very 
high effect on the output, compared to other input 
variables. As Welch et al. (1992) point out, interactions 
and nonlinear effects make this function challenging.

Important parameters: 1, 4, 5, 12, 19, 20

Compare: MOAT, mars_sa, gp_sa

for running MOAT, do: psuade psuadeMOAT.in

for running mars_sa or gp_sa, do: psuade psuadeLH.in
  then launch psuade in command line mode, load
  psuadeData and run command mars_sa or gp_sa.
