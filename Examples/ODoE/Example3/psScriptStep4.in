# The previous script should have given the next 2 selections
# (17 and 22 == 18 and 24 in the original Candidate0). This
# script put these 2 selections in SelectSet2a, appends them
# with uncertainties, and creates posterior (for 14,18,19,22)

# Step 1: Select candidate 17 and 23 and write to SelectSet2a
