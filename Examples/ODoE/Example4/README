This test problem demonstrates running sequential batch ODOE
using the Fisher method directly on simulator (not RS).
* The simulation model has 3 parameters whereby parameter 3
  is the uncertain parameter with a uniform prior.
  - The largest uncertainty should be at (0.75, 0.75)
    so the largest uncertainty is around candidate 19.
* The candidate design set is a 5x5=25 candidates on a 2D
  lattice spanned by the first two inputs in the simulation
  model.
* The objective is to select 4 points in the candidate set
  in 2 batches of 2 such that some selected metric will be
  optimized.
* This test problem shows the use of Fisher-based method. 
* Follow the steps below to see things in action. When
  done, do: make -f MakeClean to clean up things.

PREPARATION STEPS:
==========================================================

Step 0: Preparation (psuade < psScriptStep0.in)

 A. Create an initial candidate set

    To create a candidate set, do:

      cc -o candidate candidate.c -lm 
      ./candidate
      ====> CandidateSet0

 B. Create a prior sample PriorSample
 
    a. psuade psuadeGenPrior.in to create psuadeData

    b. load psuadeData and use 'iwrite PriorSample'
       ====> PriorSample

**********************************************************
FIND 4 OPTIMAL DESIGN POINTS
==========================================================

Step 1: run optimal experimental design

        RUN: psuade < psScriptStep1.in
