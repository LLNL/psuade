Both examples ((2sdata1a 2sdata1b) and (2sdata2a 2sdata2b)
are obtained from the website:

http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/KS-test.html

The t-test example shows that large non-normality causes problems 
for t-test even for large sample.  In this case K-S does fine.

1. use 2stest: try t-test and KS test
   
   data set: 2sdata1a, 2sdata1b 
             This data set is non-normal and their means differ
             significantly, but t-test does not work well (it accepts
             the NULL hypothesis). KS works better (it rejects H0).

   data set: 2sdata2a, 2sdata2b 
             This data set is non-normal and their means differ
             significantly, but t-test does not work well (it accepts
             the NULL hypothesis) even though the sample size is quite
             large. KS works better (it rejects H0).

2. use 1stest

a. distribution fit: 
   * gauss1a: use normal with mean = 0.1, std = 2
   * gauss1b: use normal with mean = 0.1, std = 2

b. chi-squared or distribution fit (normal)
   * gauss1c 
     mean = 0.1, std = 2

3. You can also create your own sample for test

   E.g. use gendist 
   * gendist with 10000 points and, say, normal
   * at the end a file sample1D will have been created
   * cut out the first column, say, by using 
         cat sample1D | cut -c11-1000 > abc
         mv abc sample1D
         Change the first line of sample1D to 10000
   * now you can use sample1D for 1stest
