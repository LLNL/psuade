2D test function

F(x1,x2) = [0.8R + 0.35 sin(2.4 pi R / sqrt(2))] (1.5 * sin(1.3 theta))

where R = sqrt(x1*x1 + x2*x2) 
      theta = arctan(x2/x1) on 0 <= x1, x2 <= 1.

Sampling-based reliability analysis (no RS used, although one can
use a response surface in place of the simulator)
- use adaptive sampling 

example upper bounds for safety = 1.5 (Rel = 0.9758)
                                  1.0 (Rel = 0.9015)
                                  0.5 (Rel = 0.4471)
                                  0.2 (Rel = 0.1291)

psScript1.in runs the reliability analysis using upper bound = 1
psScript2.in runs the same reliability analysis but use response
             surface
