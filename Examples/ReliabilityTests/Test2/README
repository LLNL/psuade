This example has a threshold boundary that is wavy
(a sine wave). The larger `scale' (inside simulator.c)
is, the more wavy the boundary is, and the finer refinement
resolution is required.

To run, first do:

    cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm

then run:

    psuade < scr

Afterward run:

    psuade < scr2 

    multiple times until you observe reliability convergence.

The answer should be 12.5%

***********************************************************
Use scale = 2, 4, .. to 
investigate convergence 
The large scale is, the more wavy the boundary is
