This directory contains an example of how to link your
C++ user program to the PSUADE library of functions.

To initiate this example, you need to do the following:

1. build psuade library 
2. set up the include files

   cd ../../build/include
   cp ../../Src/*/*.h .

3. run: make

4. now you have the psuade_api file, now you can run this
   executable.

5. Afterward, you can use matlab to view some of the results

There isn't a document to describe all the functions, but
you can go to the Src directory and browse the .h files to
see the available function in each class.
For example, all FuncApprox (response surface) classes have
uniform function calls.

optCobyla test: 

   Solution: (4 6 10 5 3 1 0 11 10 7)
   min = -31

optBobyla test: 

   Solution: all 1's, min = 0

optNomad test: input 1, 2, 4 are integers, input 3 is continuous

   Solution: min=-40.957, X=(0, 1, 2.236, 0)

optNewuoa test: unconstrained optimization 

   Solution: all 1's, min = 0
   Solution: min=-40.957, X=(0, 1, 2.236, 0)

optLincoa test: equality-unconstrained optimization 

   Solution: 1/3 2/3
   Solution: min=-0.6666
