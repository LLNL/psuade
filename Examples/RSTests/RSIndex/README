This example shows how to evaluate a response 
surface with reduced number of inputs.

The function is

   Y = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 * X4

===============================================
To run:
                                                                                
cd to this directory

(1) cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
(2) psuade psuade4.in
    (This step creates a sample of 4 inputs)
(3) rename psuadeData psData4.256 and make sure
    this file has an rs_index_file = indexFile:
    * indexFile has set the first 3 inputs to be used
    * indexFile has set the 4th input to default=2
(4) psuade psuade3.in
    * You may change rstype too (default = MARS)
    * What this does is to evaluate another sample
      using the 4-input response surface created
      from psData4.256 with input 4 fixed at 2
      and compute sensitivity indices on the 3 
      inputs.
