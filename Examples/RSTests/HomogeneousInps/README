Some applications, e.g. traders models, may have homogeneous
(or indistinguishable/interchangeable) inputs (which should
also have the same input ranges), meaning that changing their 
ordering does not change the simulation result.

The test problem is a 50- or 100-dimensional quadratic model 
and the problem is homogeneous because the model gives the 
same output even if the inputs are re-ordered. In this case,
a few response surface methods are available:

- homogeneous regression
- homogeneous Kriging
- homogeneous GP

Homogeneous regression wins because the model is quadratic.

- run psuade on psuade50.in or psuade100.in
- run rscheck using homogeneous Legendre or GP
