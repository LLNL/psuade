Derivate-based RS methods

The test problem is a quadratic function:
    Y = X1 * X1 + X2 * X2 + X3 * X3

The simulation model is simulator.c which
computes Y as well as dY/dXi

Steps:
   cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
   psuade psuade.in
   mv psuadeData simdata
   psuade
   > load simdata
   > rscheck
     <choose output 1>

* RESULT:
* Mean     =   4.0000e+00
* Variance =   4.2667e+00
* Conditional variance    1 =   1.4222e+00
* Conditional variance    2 =   1.4222e+00
* Conditional variance    3 =   1.4222e+00
