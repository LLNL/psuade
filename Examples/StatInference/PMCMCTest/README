Parallel MCMC test

Steps:

1. Make sure psuade has been compiled in parallel mode

2. Prepare the psuade data file
   * cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
   * psuade psuadeRS.in (run in serial mode)
   * mv psuadeData psdata

3. Launch psuade in parallel

   * mpirun -np x psuade -mp
   * a prompt will be displayed, do
     > load psdata
     > printlevel 3
     > rsmcmc
       when asked for spec file, enter : mcmcFile
       when asked for response surface, enter : 0 (4 times for 4 outputs)
     > at the end, you should see a matlabmcmc2.m file
       use Matlab to view it
