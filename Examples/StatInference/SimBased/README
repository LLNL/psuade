To begin:  
- Read the simulator.c file.
  * This program outputs the differences between the simulator
    outputs and data Y (so both simulation and data are embedded
    in simulator.c. This is the reason to use zero mean in the
    experimental file - mcmcFile)

- read the mcmcFile
  mcmcFile contains the data:
  * (1 4 0) means 1 experimental data set, 4 outputs, and no 
    design parameter
  * line 2: exp number, out 1 mean, out 1 std dev, out 2 mean,..
  * experimental data enclosed by PSUADE_BEGIN and PSUADE_END 

** PSUADE takes the 4 outputs (differences between observations 
   and simulation) and creates a likelihood function using 
   information in mcmcFile.

** The priors have been prescribed in psuade.in as uniform
   in [0,1] (implicitly) for both parameters

** PSUADE runs MCMC given priors and the likelihood function.

** to run:

- create simulator: cc -c simulator simulator.c -lm
- launch psuade without any argument
  psuade
  > load psuade.in
  > mcmc
  ...
  enter: mcmcFile
  > quit
- Use matlab to view matlabmcmc2.m

The steps have been captured by 

psScriptMH.in

just run: psuade < psScriptMH...in

The best solutiosn is (0.25, 0.75)
