***********************************************************************
PSUADE statistical inference package performs response-surface-based
Bayesian inferences. As such, it requires
- a sample (evaluated) for building response surfaces
- an experimental file 
  Note: users can embed experimental comparison within their samples
        (that is, sample outputs are square roots of negative log 
        likelihoods) and then use a 'manufactured' experimental file 
        with zero mean and unit standard deviation. The inference 
        engine will then exponentiate the square root of negative 
        logLikelihood (negLL) during MCMC (that is, compute 
        exp(-0.5*(negLL-mean)^2/std^2))

Since statistical inference using response surfaces is relatively
cheap computationally, 3 inference methods are provided in PSUADE:
- brute force (not smart sampling such as MCMC)
- MCMC with multiple chains and Gibbs sampling
- MCMC with multiple chains and MH sampling

Note: In many cases the MH and brute force methods may be faster
      than the MCMC-Gibbs method because Gibbs searching may be
      expensive.  If high dimensions or when the posterior is 
      focused in a tiny region, the brute force method may have 
      problems due to uniform sampling. MH and Gibbs also have
      problems with high-dimensionality.
=======================================================================
Inference with discrepancy models:
There are several  ways discrepancy models can be incorporated in 
inference but only two are provided in PSUADE:
- A constant discrepancy function
- A discrepancy model as a function of the design variables

If you select discrepancy modeling, you need to specify the point 
(the values of the uncertain parameters) at which the discrepancy
function is to be created. This will in default be the midpoint of 
the uncertain parameter ranges.

The discrepancy function may be created by
a. subtracting the simulation outputs from the experimental data at
   the experimental conditions
b. a response surface constructed from the results of (a)

If the results of (a) cannot be fitted well with a response surface,
then the posteriors will still be valid, but if you are to use the
posteriors as well as the discrepancy model for prediction, it may
have large errors (because a response surface will be needed for the 
discrepancy model to perform prediction)
***********************************************************************
At the end of inference, and in the matlabmcmc2.m file (which can be
used to display the posterior plots), there will be MLE negative log
likelihood value. If that value is far from 0, then you may need to
use discrepancy model, because the simulation results and experimental
data appear to be far apart.
