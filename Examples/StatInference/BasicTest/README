Test Problem 0: a very simple inference
                Linear equation Y = X - 0.5 
                and experiment is N(0,0.1).
     Has been verified with MH and Gibbs and BF

Test Problem 1: a simple inference
         Linear equation Y_i = X1 * A_i + X2 * B_i for i=1,..4
         Return error: E_i = Y_i - Y(A_i=0.25,B_i=0.75)
         Experiment is N_i(0,0.1), i=1,..4.
     Has been verified with MH and Gibbs and BF

Test Problem 2: This problem demonstrates Bayesian inference 
     when there are uncertain parameters that are not to be
     calibrated (That is, uncertain parameters with FIXED
     distributions).

Bobyqa: the same as test problem 1 except that it uses
        deterministic optimization

===========================================================
To use posterior sample to estimate uncertainties, do:
- Convert the posterior sample into PSUADE format
   psuade
   > iread MCMCPostSample
   > write <postsample>
- Uncertainty estimation with posterior
   psuade
   > load <simulation data file in PSUADE format>
     <If simulation has multiple outputs, select only one by
      deleting the other outputs using odelete>
   > rsua
     <select response surface>
     <select user-provided sample and enter postsample>
     <select average or worst case>
     ...
     <at the end, prediction uncertainties will be displayed>

NOTE: This procedure will be a little more complicated if
      there are design inputs and uncertain inputs in the
      simulation model.
