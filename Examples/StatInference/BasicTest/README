Test Problem 0: a very simple inference

Test Problem 1: a simple inference

Test Problem 2: This problem demonstrates Bayesian inference 
     when there are uncertain parameters that are not to be
     calibrated (That is, uncertain parameters with FIXED
     distributions).

Bobyqa: the same as test problem 1 except that it uses
        deterministic optimization
