This test demonstrates how you can fix parameters in the 
sample that is used to create response surfaces for use 
in MCMC (that is, freeze some parameters at some values
so that they do not participate in MCMC, or use some
parameters as uncertain but not to be calibrated).

The idea is to use an index file to specify which inputs
are fixed. For example, this example has in 'indexFile'

5
1 0 0.4
2 2 0
3 3 0
4 4 0
5 999 1 sample1D

which means that 
Input 1 is fixed at 0.4 ('0' to indicate fixed, and 0.4 as 
                         the value)
Input 2, 3,4 are uncertain/design parameters
      (2, 3, 4 to indicate as such, and '0' is needed but 
       will be ignored)
Input 5 is a uncertain parameter that is not to be calibrated
      but it has a distribution represented by sample1D.

The optimal answer for Input 2 and 3 should be
Input 2 = 0.3
Input 3 = 1.7
