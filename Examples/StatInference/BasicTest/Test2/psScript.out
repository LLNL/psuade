TO GAIN ACCESS TO DIFFERENT OPTIONS: TURN ON

 * ana_expert to finetune MCMC parameters, 
   (e.g. sample size for burn-in can be adjusted).
 * rs_expert to customize response surface for MCMC,
 * printlevel 3 to display more diagnostics info.
 * printlevel 4 to display even more diagnostics.
 * printlevel >=5 reserved only for expert only.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF MCMC:
 * Support other than uniform prior distributions
 * Support likelihood functions from multiple outputs
 * Option to include response surface errors for polynomial
   regressions, bootstrapped MARS, and Gaussian process (GP).
   - can be selected in ana_expert mode.
 * Option to include model form errors in the form of discrepancy
   models
   - can be selected in ana_expert mode.
 * Option to set some inputs as design parameters
   - to be specified in the observation data spec file
 * Option to disable some parameters (set to default)
   - in case these parameters are not to be calibrated
   - use rs_index_file in PSUADE's ANALYSIS section
   - not available with discrepancy modeling
 * Option to generate a posterior sample
   - can be selected in ana_expert mode
 * MCMC can be terminated gracefully by creating a file named
   'psuade_stop' in the same directory while it is running
   (if it takes too long).
 * For multi-modal posteriors, a large number of chains may be
   needed. The number of chains can be adjusted in ana_expert mode.
 * In GM mode, you have a few options to choose from:
   1. track proposal distribution at each MCMC iteration
      (MCMCDistTrack.m will be created at each iteration to give a
       snapshot of the current proposal distribution)
       NOTE: iteration will pause until further instructions
   2. track posterior distributions after each MCMC cycle
      (MCMCChainHistogram.m will be created after each cycle to give
       a snapshot of the current parameter posterior distributions.
       NOTE: iteration will pause until further instructions

MCMC creates a Gaussian likelihood function. Please provide a data
file containing design parameter values, mean, and std. dev. of the
observation data for each output.
NOTE: Design parameters should be defined in the observation data
   file if the data used in MCMC are collected at different design
   points.
IMPORTANT: IF m DESIGN PARAMETERS ARE SPECIFIED, YOU NEED TO SPECIFY
   WHICH ONES THEY ARE. THESE DESIGN PARAMETERS WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM
   THE CALIBRATION PARAMETER SET.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
** OBSERVATION DATA FILE FORMAT : (O1 = Output 1, 
        M   - no. of design parameters, 
        K   - no. of model outputs, 
        P   - no. of experiments 
        O1m - Output 1 mean
        O1s - Output 1 std. dev.
        OKs - Output K std. dev.
PSUADE_BEGIN

P <design values...> <O1m> <O1s> ... <OK> 
PSUADE_END
# num_replications = <x> (Optional command)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The likelihood function is in the form of:
  C exp(-0.5*S) 
where C is the normalization constant and
  S=sum_{p=1}^P sum_{k=1)^K (Y_pk-m_pk)^2/sd_pk^2
where K is the number of outputs and m_pk and sd_pk are the mean and
  std. dev. of output k of experiment k.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Alternatively, your simulator (or response surface) output may
      be some error measure from comparison of all model outputs with
      observation data. In this case, set nOutputs=1, mean=0 and sd=1
      in the specification file (i.e. your simulation output is 'S'
      above, and MCMC will compute likelihood as :
            C exp(-0.5 S).
      However, if you choose this option and you want to add response
      surface uncertainty, you need to be very careful.

Maximum likelihood estimated solution:
Input   1 =   1.14809338e-01
Negative log likelihood (unnormalized) = 1.080541e-04

MCMC: matlabmcmc2.m file has been created.
INFO: Use matlab/scilab-mcmc2 file to visualize posteriors.
INFO: If you selected to create a posterior sample, you will find it
      in 'MCMCPostSample', along with useful likelihood information:
      * Information that tells you which experiment may be off
      * Information that indicates whether discrepancy is needed.
INFO: If you selected to use discrepancy, you should see a sample file
      called 'psDiscrepancyModel' (You can perform a response surface
      analysis on it).
INFO: MCMCPostSample/psDiscrepancyModel can be used for prediction
      with the 'mcmc_predict' command.
