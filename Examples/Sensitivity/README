EntropyDists - checking entropies for normal 
               and lognormal distributions

Bungee - study of local SA method and also
         entropy-based methods (with and without
         RS)

Ishigama - extensive study of different SA
           methods

EntropyTest1 - a test problem where entropy
               results are different from VCE
               results

EntropyTest2 - a test problem where entropy
               results are different from VCE
               results

Note: entropy-based methods give importance
      to distribution tails while variance-based
      methods only quantify output variability
