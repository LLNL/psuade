===================================================
The Sobol g-function

f = product_i^n g_i(x_i)

where

g_i = (| 4 x_i - 2 | + a_i ) / (1 + a_i)

n = 8

0 <= x_i <= 1

a[1-8] = [0, 1, 4.5, 9, 99, 99, 99, 99]

Main effect:
Input k = 1 / 3 (1 + a[k])^2

Total effect:
Input k = 1 / 3 (1 + a[k])^2 * 
          Prod_{l=1,l!=k)^8 (1 + 1/(3(1+a[l])^2)

mean     = 1
variance = 0.4652

sensitivity coefficients VCE(i)/V
X1          0.7165
X2          0.1791
X3          0.0237

===================================================
Many approaches to compute sensitivity coefficients:

1. LH-based main effect

cc -o ensemble_simulator ensemble_simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeGenRLH.in

Launch PSUADE and load psuadeData and run vce1_bin

2. FAST-based main effect

cc -o ensemble_simulator ensemble_simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeFAST.in

Launch PSUADE and load psuadeData and run vce1_fast

3. LH-based main effect with sampling refinement
   (This method begins with 300 sample points, and
   refinements and main effect analysis will be
   performed after each refinement. Observe the
   changes in the VCE indices - should be more
   accurate with more refinements)

cc -o ensemble_simulator ensemble_simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeRLHRefine.in

4. RS-based main effect or pairwise effect based on 
   integration

   first, run: psuade psuadeRS.in
   then, move psuadeData to simdata
   finally, run: psuade psuadeRSME.in or psuadeRSIE.in
