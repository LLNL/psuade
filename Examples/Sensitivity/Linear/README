This test problem is a linear model

   Y = X1 - 2 X2 + 3 X3

I. Local sensitivity analysis

   * compile model

     cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm

   * run psuade in batch mode:

     psuade psuadeLSA.in

   * analyze

     psuade
     > load psuadeData
     > lsa
     ...

II. Correlation analysis 

   * compile model

     cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm

   * run psuade in batch mode:

     psuade psuadeCa.in

   * analyze

     psuade
     > load psuadeData
     > ca
     ...
