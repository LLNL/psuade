Experiment 1: Look at the function Y = X with 2
              different input distributions

1a. Y = X   X in [-0.5, 0.5]     (wide)
1b. Y = X   X in [-0.25, 0.25]   (narrower)

Compare VCE and entropy1 (Cannot use RS because 
it is an discontinuous function)

Steps for entropy:
* cc -o simulator1a simulator1a.c -lm
* cc -o simulator1b simulator1b.c -lm
* launch psuade, load psuade1a.in/psuade1b.in 
  and run 'entropy1' 

1a. entropy result: -1.637489e+00 == total entropy 
1b. entropy result: -3.601455e+00 == total entropy 

Steps for VCE:
* psuade psuade1a.in
  rename psuadeData sim1a
* psuade psuade1b.in
  rename psuadeData sim1b
* launch psuade, load sim1a/sim1b, and run vce1_bin

1a. VCE result: 4.17e-02 
1b. VCE result: 5.11e-03

======================================================
Experiment 2: Use different binning in entropy1

Steps for entropy:
* cc -o simulator1a simulator1a.c -lm
* cc -o simulator1b simulator1b.c -lm
* launch psuade, load psuade1a.in/psuade1b.in, turn on
  ana_expert mode, run entropy1, and select nLevels=200. 

2a. entropy result: -1.971764e+00 = total entropy
2b. entropy result: -4.113799e+00 = total entropy

Question for you: Why the answers are different in 1a 
   and 2a (also 1b and 2b) just by changing the number
   of levels in binning? Is entropy calculation then
   sensitive to number of bins used?

======================================================
Experiment 3: combine 2a and 2b (Y = X1 + X2 so there
              is no interaction)

X1 in [-0.5, 0.5]     ==> Y = Y + X1
X2 in [-0.25, 0.25]   ==> Y = Y + X2

Since this is an abrupt function, response surface
SA methods are not recommended. Thus we use vce1_bin
and entropy1

Steps for entropy1:
* cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
* start psuade, load psuade.in, and run 'entropy1' 
* result: Y = X1 + 10 X2 within ranges
  Input 1 entropy = 3.552058e+00 
  Input 2 entropy = 3.828246e+00 
  Total output entropy = 2.073763e-01
* result: Y = X1 + 5 X2 within ranges
  Input    1 entropy = 4.336776e+00
  Input    2 entropy = 3.399609e+00
  Total output entropy = -2.212597e-01

Steps for vce1_bin 
* cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
* psuade psuade2.in
* launch psuade, load psuadeData, run vce1_bin
* result: Y = X1 + 10 X2 within ranges
  Input 1, 1st-order effect =  7.41e-02 (raw =  4.17e-02)
  Input 2, 1st-order effect =  9.26e-01 (raw =  5.21e-01)
* result: Y = X1 + 5 X2 within ranges
  Input 1, 1st-order effect =  2.42e-01 (raw =  4.17e-02)
  Input 2, 1st-order effect =  7.58e-01 (raw =  1.30e-01)

Q: Why is entropy result different from VCE results for
   Y = X1 + 5 X2?
