The Sobol g-function

f = product_i^n g_i(x_i)

where

g_i = (| 4 x_i - 2 | + a_i ) / (1 + a_i)

n = 8

0 <= x_i <= 1

a[1-8] = [0, 1, 4.5, 9, 99, 99, 99, 99]

mean     = 1
variance = 0.4652

sensitivity coefficients VCE(i)/V
X1          0.7165
X2          0.1791
X3          0.0237
X4          0.0072
X5-8        0.0001

===================================================
Two approaches to compute sensitivity coefficients:

1. LH-based main effect

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeLH.in

2. FAST-based main effect

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeFAST.in

3. LH-based main effect with sampling refinement
   (This method begins with 200 sample points, and
   refinements and main effect analysis will be
   performed after each refinement. Observe the
   changes in the VCE indices - should be more
   accurate with more refinements)

cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeRLH.in

4. RS-based main effect or pairwise effect based on 
   integration

   first, run: psuade psuadeRS.in
   then, move psuadeData to psData
   finally, run: psuade psuadeRSME.in or psuadeRSIE.in 

5. RS-based main effect based on RLH on RS

   first, run: psuade psuadeRSRLH.in
   then, move psuadeData to psData
   finally, run: psuade psuadeRSRLH.in
