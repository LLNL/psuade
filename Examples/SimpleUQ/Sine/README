============================================================
This example compares 3 different response surface methods
on a wavy function - sum of 2 sine functions
This example is especially designed to compare Pade with
polynomial regression and Kriging.
============================================================

Y = sin(X_1) + sin(X_2)    

X_i = U[-pi, pi]

============================================================
Objective: to compare 3 response surface:
* Kriging
* Legendre polynomial of 8th order
* Pade approximation 
------------------------------------------------------------
The 3 scripts to run these 3 methods are given as
* psScript_krig.in
* psScript_leg.in
* psScript_pade.in

The idea is: 
- to split a sample into 2 - sam1 and sam2
- sam1 is used for building response surface 
- sam2 is used as a test set

============================================================
How to run: psuade < psScript_xxxx.in

At the end, a summary statistics on the goodness of the
interpolation property on the test set is given.
Compare the 3.

* This example shows that the wavy functions such as sine,
  Pade may have an advantage.
