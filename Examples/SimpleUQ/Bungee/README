Bungee Problem:

The function is

   hmin = H - 2Mg/ k sigma

where H is the distance of the jumping platform to the ground
      M is the mass (kg)
      sigma is the number of strands in the cord
      g is gravity (9.8m/s2)
      k is the elastic constrant of one strand (N/m) = 1.5

H is uniformly distributed [40,60]
M = U(67 kg, 74 kg)
sigma = U(20,40)

99.99% for 4 standard deviations
 
sensitivity indices
H ~0.45
M ~0.01
sig ~0.54
