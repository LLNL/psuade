This is the Bungee problem but it adds 37 additional random
inputs for comparing between direct variance decomposition 
vs. screening

Bungee Problem:

The function is

   hmin = H - 2Mg/ k sigma + 5 * rand(0,1) * sin(X[i] * 2 * pi)

where H is the distance of the jumping platform to the ground
      M is the mass (kg)
      sigma is the number of strands in the cord
      g is gravity (9.8m/s2)
      k is the elastic constrant of one strand (N/m) = 1.5

H is uniformly distributed [40,60]
M = U(67 kg, 74 kg)
sigma = U(20,40)
noise for 37 inputs = 0.01 * random(0,1) * cos(5x_j), j=3,40

99.99% for 4 standard deviations
