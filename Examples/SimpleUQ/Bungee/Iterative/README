Bungee problem: running uncertainty analysis using sampling
                refinement
* Sometimes you do not know ahead the sample size needed to
  compute the uncertainty metrics accurately. As such, it may
  be desirable to adaptively add more samples until sufficient
  accuracy is attained. This example shows how to set it up.
* The key setup step is to set the num_refinements parameter
  in the METHOD section in psuade.in to, say, 4, so if it
  starts with 50 points, then after 4 levels of refinements,
  it becomes 50 * 2^4 = 800 sample points.
* After each refinement an uncertainty analysis will be
  performed and the results displayed. Observe how the
  statistics change with each refinement.
