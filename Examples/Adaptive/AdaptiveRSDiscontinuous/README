A test for response methods for discontinuous functions.
(described in simulator.c)

===============================================
To run:
                                                                                
make to create psuade executable
cd to this directory
cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm
psuade psuadeARSM.in
 - choose adaptive option 3
 - no test data
 - no auxiliary data
 - no validation data
 - choose MARS with bootstrapping
 - wait for completion

launch psuade in command line mode
 - load psuadeData
 - use rs2 to create response surface
 - use matlab to visualize
