This example shows how to perform one step of adaptive 
refinement. There are two possible cases:

(1) if the initial sample is a METIS sample, then
    one can use the arefine_metis command for one
    step of refinement.
(1) if the initial sample is not a METIS sample, 
    then one can use the arefine command.

Running PSUADE with psScript1.in, the result (by adding 
10 new points) will be a new sample file sample110.psu
that has 110 points (100 initial + 10 new).

The psScript2.in will take the 110 sample file, run 
simulation on the 10 unevaluated points, and perform 
another step of adaptive refinement and give the 
sam120.psu file (this file has 110 evaluated points
and 10 unevaluated points).

You may use iplot2 on sam120.psu to view the distribution 
of the adaptively generated sample points using Matlab.

You can continue to run psScript3.in, which will create
sam130.psu and so on for psScript4.in, psScript5.in and on.
(NOTE: You need to run these files in order from psScript1.in
       to psScript7.in to get a final sample with size 170)

IMPORTANT: while you are performing these operations,
   do not delete or change the psuadeMetisInfo file,
   which contains pertinent information for refinement
   to succeed.
