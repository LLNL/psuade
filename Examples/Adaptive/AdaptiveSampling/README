This example shows how to perform one step of adaptive 
refinement. There are two possible cases:

(1) if the initial sample is a METIS sample, then
    one can use the arefine_metis command for one
    step of refinement.
(1) if the initial sample is not a METIS sample, 
    then one can use the arefine command.

Running with psScript1.in, the result (by adding 
10 new points) will create a new sample file
that has 110 points (100 initial + 10 new).

The psScript2.in will take this file, run simulation
on the unevaluated points, and perform another step
of adaptive refinement and give the sam120.psu file.

You may use iplot2 on sam120.psu to view the distribution 
of adaptively generated sample points using Matlab.

IMPORTANT: while you are performing these operations,
   do not delete or change the psuadeMetisInfo file,
   which contains pertinent information for refinement
   to succeed.
