*************************************************************
This test problem is a Poisson problem on a 24=57x257 grid
with right hand side mostly zero except 4 selected points 
with values (5, 10, 15, 19).
The objective is to recover these 4 values by optimization
given solutions at 4 locations in the mesh.
So, the solution to this optimization problem is (5,10,15,19)

To run with Cobyla:

cc -o cobyla_simulator cobyla_simulator.c -lm

psuade psuadeCobyla.in

*************************************************************
To run with SM/MM optimizers:

* smmm_fine_sim is the Poisson problem with 257x257 mesh
* smmm_coarse_sim is the same Poisson problem with 33x33 mesh
* These models output values at the 4 designated locations
* while the one for cobyla outputs some summary error 
* statistics. 

cc -o smmm_coarse_sim smmm_coarse_sim.c -lm
cc -o smmm_fine_sim smmm_fine_sim.c -lm

1. MM
   - need to provide aux_opt_driver : smmm_coarse_sim
     need to set targetFile (the true solution at the
     selected mesh points)

     Run: psuade psuadeSMMM.in

   - both opt_driver and aux_opt_driver can be data files
     e.g. to set aux_opt_driver as a psuade sample file
          rather than an executable:
      * run psuade on psuadeRS.in (20 samples)
      * rename psuadeData to, e.g. auxData
      * Edit auxData -> change rstype to GP3
      * set aux_opt_driver in psuadeSMMM2.in as auxData
      * run: psuade psuadeSMMM2.in

3. MM_adaptive
   - need to provide aux_opt_driver as data file
   - this file will be enlarged as more fine model 
     evaluations are performed and added 
   - Run: psuade psuadeSMMM_adaptive.in
   - At the end, auxData will have more samples
   - You can try using fewer than 10 samples to begin
     with by modifying the psuadeRS.in file and redo
