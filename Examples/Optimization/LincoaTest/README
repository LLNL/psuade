Test problem:

minimize 2 X1^2 + X2^2
Constraint: X1+X2=-1
Solution: X1 = -0.33333
          X2 = -0.66666

How to run:
I. first need to provide a file called psuade_lincoa_constraints 
   to specify constraints

  For example, in the following:

PSUADE_BEGIN
1 2
1 1 1 -1
PSUADE_END

The line '1 2' means 1 constraint involving 2 variables.

The first 1 in the '1 1 1 -1' line means:
+ the first '1' : constraint 1
+ the second and third '1' : coefficients for X1 and X2
        1 * X1 + 1 * X2
+ the fourth '-1' :  the right hand side
        1 * X1 + 1 * X2 = -1

II. compile simulator.c : cc -o simulator simulator.c -lm

III. run psuade: psuade psuadeLincoa.in
