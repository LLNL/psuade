This test problem demonstrates how to perform numerical
optimization (with continuous variables only) when the
simulation model (F(X) where X are the inputs) has been
replaced with the response surfaces (\hat{F}) created 
using a training sample and the experimental data set 
(D) is to be supplied by users at runtime. So the 
formulation is:

min_{X} ||\hat{F}-D||^2


How to use this capability:

The key setup consists of:
(1) Create a training sample (to be used to create \hat{F})

    - run: psuade psuadeRS.in (after compiling simulator.c)
    - rename psuadeData to 'simdata'
    
(2) Create a data file (for D)

    - e.g. in dataFile
      * Line 1: number of data, number of inputs, input indices
      * Line 2: 1 <data 1 inputs> <data mean> <data s.d.>
      * Line 3: 2 <data 2 inputs> <data mean> <data s.d.>
      ...

(3) Create a PSUADE input file: psuadeOpt.in

    - Make sure nInputs = nInputs in training sample - 
                          nInputs in experimental set
    - set opt_driver = PSUADE_LOCAL



Then, during run time, do:

   psuade psuadeOpt.in

   * Supply simdata when asked for a training sample
   * Select response surface type for each output
   * Supply experimental data set (dataFile)

An example run script: psScript.in 
   (which uses quartic polynomial as response surface)

do: psuade psuadeOpt.in < psScript.in
