This is a contrite MOO example 

    minimize F(x1,x2) = alpha * f1 + (1 - alpha) * f2

    f1(x1,x2) = x1*x1 + x2*x2
    f2 = 1 - f1

x1,x2 = [0 1]

alpha is specified in configFile with a range
      of [0, 1]. Since it is a linear combination
      that is supported in psuade, no additional
      function to combine the outputs need to be
      provided (hence the NULL in configFile)
moo.py computes f1 and f2 (moo internally forms linear combination)
psuade.in specifies the inputs (2) and outputs (2: f1,f2)
============ how =======================
psuade
> mo_opt
  psuade.in
  moo.py <you can also use a response surface here>
  configFile
  11 (this is the resolution: number of points to use for the scale)
> quit

At the end, a file psuade_moo_sample will
be generated which has 1 input and 5 outputs
input   - alpha
output1 - optimal F(x1,x2) for the given alpha
output2 - opt x1 
output2 - opt x2 
output4 - f1(x1) for this alpha at opt x1,x2
output5 - f2(x2) for this alpha at opt x1,x2

You can use 
> load psuade_moo_sample
> splot
> quit

and use matlab to view the matlabsp.m file
(while shows the relationship of the optimal F
with alpha), and the smallest of these points
is the global solution.
