*********************************************************
Test problem 1

min X1*X1 + X2*X2

subject to
x1+x2-1 >= 0
X1*X1+X2*X2-1 >= 0
9X1*X1+X2*X2-9 >= 0
X1*X1-X2 >= 0
X2*X2-X1 >= 0

5 constraints ==> 6 outputs
Initial guess is: X1 = 10, X2 = 10

Solution is:
X1 = 1
X2 = 1
Ymin =   2

*********************************************************
Test problem 2: see simulator2.c 

8 constraints + 20 bound constraints ==> 29 outputs 

Solution is:
	X     1 =   4.0e+00
	X     2 =   6.0e+00
	X     3 =   1.0e+01
	X     4 =   5.0e+00
	X     5 =   3.0e+00
	X     6 =   1.0e+00
	X     7 =   0.0e+00
	X     8 =   1.1e+01
	X     9 =   1.0e+01
	X    10 =   7.0e+00
Ymin =  -3.10000000e+01
