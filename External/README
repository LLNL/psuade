Due to LLNL's software release recommendation,
the external libraries have been removed.
Nevertheless, you will need a few third-party
libraries to enable some PSUADE capabilities.
The most useful ones are:

To use OA and OALH sampling - Bose

To use MARS-based response surface and analyses,
need MARS

To use several response surfaces (DNN, HGP3, QGP3, 
HybridGP, KNN, Kriging) and optimization capabilities, 
need BOBYQA

To use Metis-based sampling and some analysis methods
(e.g. TSI), and some adaptive sampling, need - METIS

For some response surfaces such as GP, need L-BFGS-B-C

Other useful ones are:
COBYLA, LINCOA, NEWUOA
