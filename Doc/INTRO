Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the science of 
combining imperfect information from multiple 
sources to reach conclusion and assess the 
validity of these conclusions.  There are many 
uses of UQ such as sensitivity analysis, parametric 
studies, principal component analysis, model 
reduction, design explorations,  parameter 
estimation, decision analysis, and many others.  
UQ techniques can be classified as intrusive 
or non-intrusive.  In this work, we focus on 
non-intrusive techniques which allow one to treat 
the analysis code as a black box.  We will give a 
brief introduction to UQ, some R&D issues in 
developing UQ tools.  We will also describe our 
most recent work on developing UQ tools.
